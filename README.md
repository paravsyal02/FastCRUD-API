# FastCRUD API

## Description
The FastCRUD API is a simple yet efficient API built using **FastAPI**. It provides the basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for managing resources. This project is designed to showcase the power and flexibility of **FastAPI** for building fast, asynchronous, and scalable APIs.

## What I've Learned
In this project, I have learned how to build and manage APIs using **FastAPI**. I explored several key features and methods of API development, including:

- **FastAPI Basics**: Setting up and deploying APIs quickly with minimal boilerplate.
- **CRUD Operations**: Implementing Create, Read, Update, and Delete endpoints to manage resources.
- **Request Validation**: Using Pydantic models to validate incoming requests and responses.
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Taking advantage of FastAPI's support for async and await for improved performance.
- **Dependency Injection**: Using FastAPI’s built-in dependency injection system for cleaner and more modular code.
- **Database Integration**: Connecting the API to databases for data persistence (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL).

## Features

- **Create**: Create new resources.
- **Read**: Retrieve resources based on various filtering criteria.
- **Update**: Modify existing resources.
- **Delete**: Remove resources from the system.
- **Validation**: Request and response validation using Pydantic models.
- **Async Support**: Non-blocking asynchronous API endpoints.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- FastAPI
- Uvicorn (ASGI server for FastAPI)
- Pydantic (for data validation)
- Any database for persistence (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL)

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FastCRUD-API.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd FastCRUD-API
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. (Optional) Set up the database or modify the configuration for your desired database.

## Running the API

1. To run the FastAPI application, use Uvicorn:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

2. The API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

3. You can view the interactive documentation by navigating to:
   - Swagger UI: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`
   - ReDoc: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc`

## Technologies Used

- **FastAPI**: A modern web framework for building APIs with Python 3.8+.
- **Uvicorn**: ASGI server used to run FastAPI.
- **Pydantic**: Data validation and settings management library.
- **SQLite/PostgreSQL**: Databases for data storage (if applicable).
- **Python 3.8+**: Programming language for building the API.
